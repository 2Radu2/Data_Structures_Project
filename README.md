# Data_Structures_Project
The Program starts with the menu of FLYWAY'S AIRLINE SYSTEM, and gives you the following options to: Reserve, Cancel, Display Records (which are functions in our program) and Exit. 
I decided to develop a program, that uses the switch statement to decide from the cases: Reserve, Cancel, Display Records and Exit. Each and every one of those cases has different properties such as: 
	If a passenger would want to book a seat it would be needed for chose the case "Reserve" that would make him chose the seat he wants, if the seat is already occupied it would give the message " This seat is already reserved" and make him chose another one.
	After choosing a proper seat the program requires a name, if the program detects that your "name" has anything other than letters (examples: Radu1 or Radu_1) or random consecutive spaces (example: Radu__Enachescu), it sends the message: "ERROR please introduce a name, not numbers or other characters."
	After that the program requires to enter your passport number that needs to be made with strictly 6 digits, no more or less, if the program detects a letter in the passport number is sends the message: "Your passport number must not contain anything other than digits." , if the number is longer or shorter than 6 digits it sends out the message: "ERROR your passport number is too long/short".
	When it comes to the email address you need to add the "@" otherwise it will appear the error: "ERROR please enter a valid email address including @".
	After the email you need to enter the destination, you want to go if your destination had digits in it will appear the error: "ERROR please introduce a destination, not numbers."
